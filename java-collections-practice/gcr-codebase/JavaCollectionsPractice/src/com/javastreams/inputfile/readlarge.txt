This is a sample text used for testing large file handling in Java.
The purpose of this file is to simulate real-world scenarios where
applications need to process large amounts of data efficiently.

Java InputStream and OutputStream classes are commonly used for reading
and writing byte data. Buffered streams help improve performance by
reducing the number of I/O operations. ByteArray streams store data
temporarily in memory, while file streams interact with the file system.

Multithreading in Java allows multiple threads to run concurrently.
Threads share memory but have separate execution paths. Proper
synchronization is required to avoid race conditions and ensure data
consistency. Piped streams are useful for inter-thread communication.
