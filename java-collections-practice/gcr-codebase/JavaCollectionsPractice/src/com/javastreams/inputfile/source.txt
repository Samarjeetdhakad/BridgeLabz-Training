Java I/O streams are used to read and write data efficiently. Buffered streams
reduce the number of physical I/O operations by storing data temporarily in
memory. This improves performance significantly when working with large files.
Character streams handle Unicode text, while byte streams handle binary data.
Using proper buffering and encoding ensures data integrity and faster execution.
